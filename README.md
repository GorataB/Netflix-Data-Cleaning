# Netflix-Data-Cleaning

## Introduction
This project will introduce students to an array of skills as they strive to access and prepare data for further analysis, a process referred to as data cleaning. Whenever data scientists work with any dataset, they must complete this process first to ensure the data is in a suitable format. In this project, students will be able to learn the process and apply it to a Netflix dataset. You should be able to apply this same process to all future datasets you would like to use for data science analysis.

### Project Overview
The main goal of this project is to set up the environment, install the required packages, learn how to access data and do some basic exploratory data analysis.

### Project Environment
I used Google Colab for this project and Jupyter as the IDE. The packages used were pandas and numpy. 

### Additional
Further information, including the data is available on the notebook.
